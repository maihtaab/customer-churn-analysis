# 💡 Customer Churn Analysis

This project explores customer behavior data to identify patterns associated
with customer churn in a telecommunications service. The analysis focuses on
customer tenure and monthly charges to understand early indicators of churn
risk and customer retention.

## Objectives
- Explore how tenure and pricing relate to customer churn
- Identify early churn risk patterns through exploratory data analysis
- Demonstrate how insights can be translated into a simple predictive model

## Data Source
Publicly available Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Key Insights
- Customers who churn tend to have significantly shorter tenure  
- Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn risk  
- Early-stage customers on higher-cost plans appear most vulnerable  

## Modeling
A simple logistic regression model was used as a baseline to demonstrate how
exploratory insights can be translated into churn prediction.

## Notes
This project prioritizes clarity, interpretability, and real-world relevance
over complex modeling.
